BMON is a web-based software application that stores and analyzes sensor data coming from buildings or other facilities. 
The application was developed by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) 
to find ways to reduce the energy use and improve the maintenance of some of 
their buildings. The application presents a simple user interface for 
viewing data, but includes informative charts such as Histograms and 
Hourly Profile charts for analyzing the data. Alerts can be set up to text 
or email individuals if sensor values move outside normal ranges.

Here is a link to the [AHFC BMON Web Site](https://bms.ahfc.us).
